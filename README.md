# DungeonGame
This is a project that implements the A* algorithm with a graphical representation made in SDL. The map and the start/end points are editable.
When the program is launched the map is displayed, and the character stands on the starting block. When the A* algorithm is done executing, if it finds a path, it will show it by moving the character after a few seconds, until it reaches the goal. Otherwise, it will print an error to the console and the program will close.
